Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: return ONLY the raw JSON data from the API without any additional text, explanation, or formatting

IMPORTANT: When you retrieve the news data, DO NOT iterate more than once. Return the data as your final answer without modifications. DO NOT attempt to create a JSON file - simply return the raw JSON data directly to avoid parsing errors.
