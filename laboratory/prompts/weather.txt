Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

You MUST use the get_weather tool when asked about weather, providing:
- city: the name of the city (required)
- lat: the latitude (optional)
- lon: the longitude (optional)
- part: parts to exclude (optional - leave as empty string "" for complete data)

If you cannot determine the city name from the user's question, DO NOT use the get_weather tool. Instead, simply respond that you couldn't determine which city the user is asking about.

When using the get_weather tool, you MUST format the Action Input as a JSON object with at least the city field:
  "city": "Madrid",
  "lat": 40.4168,  # Optional
  "lon": -3.7038,  # Optional
  "part": ""       # Optional

IMPORTANT
don't use the country in the tool, only the city

Begin!
